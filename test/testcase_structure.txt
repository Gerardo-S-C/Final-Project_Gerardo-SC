First line contains only the number of operators and the number of machines.
E.g. 5 operators and 4 machines is: 5 4
Separated by a space character.

The next n lines must consist of m rows (n = 5 & m = 4 in this case).

The next line must consist, again, of the number of operators and machines.
It MUST be the same as before.

The last lines must consist of only integers.
The first of those MUST be only ONE integer (without size constraint).
The next lines can be of diferent sizes BUT they must be separated by spaces characters.
