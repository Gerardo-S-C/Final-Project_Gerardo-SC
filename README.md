# Polyploid Genetic Algorithm with Adaptive Parameters for Multi-Objective Task Scheduling

This repository contains the implementation of a Polyploid Genetic Algorithm (PGA) integrated with the NSGA-II framework to solve the Multi-Objective Task Scheduling problem. The system optimizes two conflicting objectives: execution time (makespan) and energy consumption. It features a polyploid encoding scheme and an adaptive parameter control mechanism.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, the following software and libraries are required:

### C++ Environment
* A C++ compiler compatible with the C++17 standard (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).

### Python Environment
* Python 3.8 or higher.
* Required Python libraries:
    * pymoo (for Hypervolume calculation)
    * matplotlib (for plotting)
    * seaborn (for plotting)
    * pandas (for data manipulation)
    * numpy (for numerical operations)

You can install the Python dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pymoo matplotlib seaborn pandas numpy
```

Compilation and Execution
1. Compiling the C++ Core
The core evolutionary algorithm is implemented in C++. To compile the source code, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 *.cpp -o main
```
Note: If you are on Windows, this will generate main.exe. On Linux/macOS, it will generate the binary main.

2. Running the Algorithm
Execute the compiled binary to start the evolutionary process. This will read the instance files from the test/ directory and generate the raw data logs (checkpoints and final results) in the output directory.

```bash
.\main
```

The program will execute the algorithm across multiple seeds and scenarios as defined in main.cpp.

3. Data Analysis and Visualization (Python)
Once the C++ execution is complete, you must run the Python scripts in the following specific order to process the data, generate visualizations, and calculate metrics.

Step 1: Generate Gantt Charts Run the gantt script first. This reads the final schedules generated by the C++ program and creates visual Gantt charts for the best solutions found.

```bash
python gantt.py
```

Step 2: Plot Pareto Fronts Run the plot_fronts script next. This reads the checkpoint files to visualize the Pareto fronts, showing the trade-off between makespan and energy consumption for different policies and seeds.

```bash
python plot_fronts.py
```

Step 3: Calculate Hypervolume Finally, run the hypervolume script. This uses the pymoo library to calculate the Hypervolume indicator for the generated fronts, providing a quantitative metric for convergence and diversity.

```bash
python hypervolume.py
```

Project Structure
- *.cpp / *.h: C++ source code files (main logic, genetic operators, policies).

- test/: Directory containing the benchmark text instances (Eg1, Eg2, Eg3).

- results/: Directory where the C++ program outputs the CSV logs.

- plots/: Directory where the Python scripts save the generated figures.

## Author note
I wrote this in EN rather than ES because I find it easier to write code this way, also because I find it funnier tbh.
